# Analyzing-NYC-High-School-Data

This project uses pandas, Numpy, re, matplotlib, Basemap.

For this project we will be using data about New York City public schools.

One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Given our prior knowledge of this topic, investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to take. We could correlate SAT scores with factors like race, gender, income, and more.
